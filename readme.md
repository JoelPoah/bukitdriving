Main branch is for macbook which is how I will run the server.
To start program do sh shell.sh 


Fixes:
1. Duration of the program to run before it kills chrome

Features:
1. Aggressive booking in a separate branch ( mainly on windows first then create a separate branch for macbook)


for testing change:
